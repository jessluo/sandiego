##{ Join physical and biological data -------------------------------------

# select only downcasts since biological data was aquired only on down casts
# phyB <- phyB[phyB$down.up == "down",]
# # select only downcasts in which all the biological data is present (transect 2 only)
# dc <- unique(bio$cast.bio[which(bio$group=="Hydromedusae" & bio$transect==2)])
# phyB <- phyB[which(phyB$down.up=="down" & phyB$transect==2 & phyB$cast %in% dc),]
# bioB <- bioB[which(bioB$transect==2 & bioB$cast.bio %in% dc),]
# ---

# one problem with selecting only downcasts is that if one depth bin spans both downcasts and upcasts, then both the duration of the depth bin as well as the volume sampled is wrong, which changes the calculated concentration of the organisms

# this has to do with the NAs in the timeBins ... see above comment in the timeBins section. Maybe caused by the binning process?
